You can read the details about the mathematicl theory in the accompanying PDF paper: [2018 Mayaux - Horizon-Based Indirect Lighting (HBIL).pdf](./2018 Mayaux - Horizon-Based Indirect Lighting (HBIL).pdf).


# Build

You pretty much need the entire [GodComplex](../../) repository because the project relies on various image, rendering, math and tool libraries present in my framework.

Open the [Tests.sln](../../Tests.sln) solution file, ideally with Visual Studio 2012, choose "Debug/Release" configuration and the "x64" platform and build.
