To get the scenes for this directory, go to http://3drender.com/challenges/index.htm and download the following files:

* http://3drender.com/challenges/artistry/artistry_OBJ.rar
* http://3drender.com/challenges/bedroom/Bedroom_OBJ.rar
* http://3drender.com/challenges/Natural_History/Natural_History_MultiPart_OBJ.rar
* http://3drender.com/challenges/hauntedhallway/hauntedhallway_OBJ.rar

Then unpack into their own private directory (e.g. WinRar shell extension => Extract to "Natural_History_MultiPart_OBJ" folder).

Be patient on the first opening of the scene since it loads, processes and caches data into binary files. The second time opening the files should be much faster!
