Changelog for AxF Decoding SDK
==============================

2018-04-18, 1.5.1
   * Support preview images with alpha channel
   * Updated and improved SDK documentation and AxF white paper; added a FAQ
   * New AxF Integration and Validation Package (will be made available separately)

2017-12-21, 1.5.0 (PANTORA 1.3.0 release)
   * Added support for AxF 1.5 representation (GGX model [Walter et al.])
   * The exported SDK functions are now in a versioned namespace to allow scenarios where the client application wants to link against multiple different AxF SDK versions.
     Since the added version namespace is (de facto) an inline namespace, this change is transparent for the user (provided that each C++ source files includes a single AxF SDK version only).

2017-02-16, 1.4.0
   * Official support for AxF 1.4 (alpha- and displacement-mapping resources)
      -TextureDecoder SVBRDF representation returns 'Alpha' and 'Height' textures
      -CPUDecoder for SVBRDF representation evaluates alpha channel
      -SVBRDF compatibility profile version 2 requires support for alpha and height 
   * Two new interfaces to access AxF materials 
      -using handles (analogue to the other AxF entities)
      -based on *MaterialID* strings (analogue to the old by-name interface)
   * Accessing AxF materials by name is deprecated but still supported for backwards compatibility of existing code
   * Support of unicode strings for material names and metadata properties
        - added new function axfGetMaterialDisplayName() to retrieve the material name in UTF-16/UTF-32 encoding (depending on compiler) used for display
        - added new PropertyType TYPE_UTF_STRING denoting an array of wchar_t characters in UTF-16/UTF-32 encoding (depending on compiler) 	
   * Added new enum for texture data types to distinguish them from property data types (backwards compatible with previous constants)
   * TextureDecoder interface does not return the following auxiliary CarPaint2 properties anymore (ID_DEFAULT):
        - "hue_rot"
        - "clearcoat_scale"
        - "brdf_scale"
        - "flake_scale"
        - "btf_flake_boost"
        - "flakes_uv_scale"
        - "cc_uv_scale"
        - "btf_lightsigma_sqr"
     References to these properties should be removed, they are not necessary for the evaluation of the CarPaint2 representation. 
   * Updated and improved SDK documentation and AxF white paper

2016-07-15, 1.3.0 
   * Added support for AxF 1.3 representation (clear coat with 'NoRefraction' attribute)
   * Added details on coated materials to SDK documentation and white paper
   * Introduced more fine grained compatibility profiles for each of the main representation classes
   * Interface change: The new function axfGetPreferredRepresentation() replaces the former axfGetRepresentationWithHighestSupportedVersion() (see documentation for details)
   * Bug fix: CPA2 flake texture always returns a valid size
   * Bug fix: Proper support of Unicode filenames on Windows via axfOpenFileW()
   * Mac OS X binary: Removed the dynamic dependencies to the Accelerate and zlib libraries of the OS X SDK (for more consistency to the Windows and Linux builds of the AxF SDK)

2016-04-22, 1.2.3
   * Improved SDK documentation and AxF white paper
   * Bug fixes

2016-02-03, 1.2.2 (restricted beta)
   * Completed support for AxF 1.2 representations
   * Added basic C-style interface for accessing AxF material metadata
   * Added basic C-style interface for accessing AxF representation resources
   * Additionally incorporates all features from SDK version 1.1.2

2015-11-17, 1.2.1 (restricted beta)
   * Preliminary support for AxF 1.2 representations (such as CarPaint 2)
   * Support for AxF 1.1 representations and builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac are available for this version as well,
     but otherwise this version misses some of the features of SDK version 1.1.2 (see below) due to the earlier release date.

2016-01-18, 1.1.2
   * New SDK name and versioning scheme (major.minor.revision), where major.minor corresponds to the highest supported AxF version
   * First release with support for AxF 1.1 representations (such as SVBRDFs with clearcoat)
   * Builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac available; all external dependencies removed (except for system libraries necessarily available on the supported systems, see README.txt)
     [This includes dependency to the MSVC runtime library on Windows. Thus there is no need anymore for different MSVC build variants.]
   * Improved the documentation
   * The namespace was changed to axf::decoding
   * Added new function axfGetRepresentationClass() for indentifying the representation category (note that axfGetRepresentationType() may not be used anymore for that purpose)
   * Added new functions for checking which representations are supported by the given SDK version, including the convenience function axfGetRepresentationWithHighestSupportedVersion()
     for easy access to the material representation with the highest support representation version; removed the deprecated convenience function axfGetVeryFirstRepresentation() instead
   * Added new functions for enabling/disabling logging
   * CPUDecoder and TextureDecoder: Full support for color space conversion to the user-defined target color space (for any supported representation)
   * Several minor interface extensions and fixes
